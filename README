This is the Mixmatic Readme.

Here's what we need:
	1. Login system (users table)
	2. Mix table:
		- Mix id
		- Mix author_id (user)
		- Mix recipient_id (user)
		- Spotify url (string)
		- Message (body text)
		
TODO before launch:
	-make a better "create mix" button
	-add a mailer
	-make flash notices better
	-add a login page
	-add a "preview"
	-add mix title to the show page
	-viral buttons
	
Dealt with:
	-change the login info thing on /mixes/new so that it's hidden if you're currently
		logged in
	-create a how to find URI instructions and link that shit with a lightbox
